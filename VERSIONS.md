### 0.0.2 - Added -p option for assiging port
 - DecisionCentral listens, by default, on port 7777 for http requests. The -p portNo option was added so that you can assign the listening port. As an alternative, you can run DecisionCentrol in a container (see docerfile) and map the port at run time.
### 0.0.1 - First version
